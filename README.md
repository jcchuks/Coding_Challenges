 
This repo started out as a repo for only Hackerrank challenges.
As business got serious, I thought it will be good letting challenges be challenges

Thus: A repo for solutions to challenges.

To get your hands dirty ASAP from where I work out: 
Visit CodeFight.com, Hackerrank.com, ProjectEuler.net, leetcode.com etc.

Caveat: I do this for fun so these codes are without any warranty.
Languages: Python,C/C++
If you are human and like any of my solution:
Shoot me an email ==> "jcchuks" at  gma il dot  c o m 
Note "jcchuks" without quotes. 
About the quotes - Sorry, between humans and bots, I cant tell who behaves like who now.
